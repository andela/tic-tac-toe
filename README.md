#Tic Tac Toe Lab

+ This lab is about winning the popular tic-tac-toe game
+ You would determine if the index in the array where a player can play to win the game
+ There would be only a solution for a win per game, no multiple wins in a game
+ Spaces 3 and 7 are used as delimiters and your answer should never return them
+ 'X' and 'O' are the letters played by the players of the game and '-' is for empty spaces that are yet to be played
+ When there is no winner the game should output 'INCONCLUSIVE'



## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\tic-tac-toe.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
